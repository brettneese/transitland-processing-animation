# Visualizing transit freqency from the command line

Using Mapzen's [Transitland API](http://transit.land/) to download transit schedule data and [Processing](processing.org) with [Unfolding Maps](http://unfoldingmaps.org/) to create spatial-temporal visualizations.

Here is an example animation generated for San Francisco with a single command:

`python transitflow.py --name=san_francisco --bbox=-122.515411,37.710714,-122.349243,37.853983 --clip_to_bbox`

## Set up Processing:
1. Download [Processing 3](https://processing.org/).
2. Download [Unfolding Maps version 0.9.9 for Processing 3](http://services.informatik.hs-mannheim.de/~nagel/GDV/Unfolding_for_processing_0.9.9beta.zip).
3. Navigate to `~/Documents/Processing/libraries` on your machine.
4. Drag and drop the unzipped Unfolding Maps folder into `~/Documents/Processing/libraries`.
5. Open Processing, navigate to Sketch > Import Library > Add Libary. Search for "Video Export" and click Install.
6. Quit and re-open Processing.

## Instructions:
- Download the repository, unzip it and `cd` into it.

To run within a virtual environment (optional, recommended):
- `virtualenv virtualenv`
- `source virtualenv/bin/activate`
- `python virtualenv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt`
- `cd transitflow`

Without a virtual environment:
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- `cd transitflow`

Nowt, you are ready to download transit schedule data and generate visualizations.

There are two ways to go about using this tool:

### 1) Search by transit operator onestop_id

You can visualize a single transit operator by passing in the operator's Onestop ID. What's a Onestop ID, you ask? As part of Transitland's [Onestop ID  Scheme](https://transit.land/documentation/onestop-id-scheme/), every transit operator, route, feed and stop are assigned a unique identifier called a Onestop ID.

You can look up an operator's onestop_id using the [Transitland Feed Registery](https://transit.land/feed-registry/). For example, the onestop_id for San Francisco BART is `o-9q9-bart`.

Visualize one day of BART transit flows:

- `python transitflow.py --name=bart --operator=o-9q9-bart`

### 2) Search by bounding box

You can also visualize transit flows by searching for all operators within a bounding box (west, south, east, north). I like using [bboxfinder](bboxfinder.com) to draw rectangular bounding boxes. Here's the command to visualize transit flows in Chicago:

- `python transitflow.py --name=chicago --bbox=-87.992249,41.605175,-87.302856,42.126747 --clip_to_bbox --exclude=o-9-amtrak,o-9-amtrakcharteredvehicle`

[![IMAGE ALT TEXT](http://i.imgur.com/pH7AwgB.png)](https://vimeo.com/230857619 "Chicago Transit Flows")

Note, the optional use of `--clip_to_bbox`. This command will clip the dataset to only include transit vehicle trips within the specified bounding box, both in the geo-visualization and in the vehicle count calculations that drive the stacked bar chart.

Also, note the optional use of `--exclude`. This command will exclude specified operators, Amtrak in this case.

### Play your animation

Navigate to `sketches\bay_area\2017-08-15\sketch` and open the `sketch.pde` file.

This should open the Processing application. Simply click Play or `command + r` to play the animation.

### Change map providers

Cycle through the first two rows on the keyboard (1 to 0, q to u) to see the built in map provider options.

Read more about Unfolding Maps map providers here: http://unfoldingmaps.org/tutorials/mapprovider-and-tiles.html

### Exporting to video

Open `sketch.pde` file.

- Faster, lower quality: set `boolean recording = true;`. Generates a medium quality mp4 file.
- Slower, high quality: set `boolean recording = true;` and `boolean HQ = true;`. Generates 3,600 .tiff images. You can use then ffmpeg or Processing's built in movie maker to stitch them together.

- Visualization: The visualization incorporates Processing code from [this workshop](https://github.com/juanfrans-courses/DataScienceSocietyWorkshop) by [Juan Francisco Saldarriaga](http://juanfrans.com/) to plot trips using linear interpolation. It also relies on the [Unfolding Maps](http://unfoldingmaps.org/) library by [Till Nagel](http://tillnagel.com/) for converting geolocations to screen positions and other functions.
